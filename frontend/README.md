This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Your React App will live here.  You will need to run `npm install` to install all your dependencies before starting up the application. While in development, run this application from this location using `npm start`.

No environment variables are needed to run this application in development, but be sure to set the REACT_APP_BASE_URL environment variable when you deploy!

This app will be automatically built when you push to your main branch on Github.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
